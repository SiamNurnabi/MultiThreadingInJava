If two threads are waiting for each other to release the lock, then the condition is called a deadlock.
In this case, both threads will wait forever for each other to release the lock, and the program will never terminate. This situation is called a deadlock.

Synchronized keyword is the only reason for deadlock situation. Hence, we should be very careful while using synchronized keyword.
There are no resolution techniques for deadlock. But several prevention techniques are available to avoid deadlock.
