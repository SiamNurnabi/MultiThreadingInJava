There are 2 types of Multitasking
1. Process-based Multitasking
2. Thread-based Multitasking

Process-based Multitasking:
1. In Process-based Multitasking, multiple processes run concurrently.
2. Each process has its own memory space.
3. Each process is independent of other processes.
4. If one process is terminated, it doesn't affect other processes.
5. Process-based multitasking is heavyweight.
6. Process creation is time-consuming and resource-intensive.
7. Process switching is time-consuming.
8. Example: Running multiple applications on a computer.

Thread-based Multitasking:
1. In Thread-based Multitasking, multiple threads run concurrently.
2. Threads share the same memory space.
3. Threads are lightweight compared to processes.
4. Threads are dependent on each other.
5. If an exception occurs in one thread, it affects other threads.
6. Thread creation is less time-consuming and resource-intensive.
7. Thread switching is fast.
8. Example: Running multiple applications on a computer.

What is the difference between Process-based Multitasking and Thread-based Multitasking?
In Process-based Multitasking, multiple processes run concurrently. Each process has its own memory space. Each process is independent of other processes.
If one process is terminated, it doesn't affect other processes. Process-based multitasking is heavyweight.
Process creation is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Process switching is time-consuming.
In Thread-based Multitasking, multiple threads run concurrently. Threads share the same memory space. Threads are lightweight compared to processes.
Threads are dependent on each other. If an exception occurs in one thread, it affects other threads. Thread creation is less time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Thread switching is fast.

What is the difference between Process-based Multitasking and Thread-based Multitasking in Java?
In Java, Process-based Multitasking is achieved by running multiple Java programs. Each Java program runs in its own JVM process.
In Thread-based Multitasking, multiple threads run concurrently within the same Java program. Threads share the same memory space.

What is the difference between Process-based Multitasking and Thread-based Multitasking in Operating System?
In Operating System, Process-based Multitasking is achieved by running multiple processes concurrently. Each process has its own memory space.
In Thread-based Multitasking, multiple threads run concurrently within the same process. Threads share the same memory space.
