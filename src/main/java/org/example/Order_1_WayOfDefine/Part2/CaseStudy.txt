MyRunnable r = new MyRunnable();
Thread t1 = new Thread();
Thread t2 = new Thread(r);


Case-1 t1.start():
1. The start() will start the thread.
2. Thread class start() method internally calls the run() method.
   Which have empty implementation. So, nothing will happen.


Case-2 t1.run():
1. No new thread will be created.
   The Thread class run() method will be executed by the current thread like a normal method call.


Case-3 t2.start():
1. New thread will be created.
2. The run() method of MyRunnable class will be executed by the new thread.

Case-4 t2.run():
1. No new thread will be created.
   The run() method of MyRunnable class will be executed by the current thread like a normal method call.

Case-5 r.start():
1. Compilation error. The start() method is not available in the MyRunnable class.

Case-6 r.run():
1. No new thread will be created.
   The run() method of MyRunnable class will be executed by the current thread like a normal method call.
