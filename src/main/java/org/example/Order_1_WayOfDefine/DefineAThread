Define a thread in java?

1. By extending Thread class
2. By implementing Runnable interface
//3. By using Executor framework
//4. By using Callable and Future


By extending Thread class:
1. Create a class that extends the Thread class.
2. Override the run() method.
3. Inside the run() method, we define the task/job that is to be executed by the thread. Inside run() method,
   the code is called the JOB of the thread.
4. To start the thread, Create an object of the class and call the start() method.
4. The start() method creates a new thread and calls the run() method.
5. The run() method contains the code that is executed by the thread.
6. The thread is terminated when the run() method completes.
7. The thread can be started only once. If you try to start the thread again, it will throw an IllegalThreadStateException.
8. The thread is created and managed by the JVM.
