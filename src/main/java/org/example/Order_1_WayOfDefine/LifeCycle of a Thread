Thread life cycle:
1. New: The thread is in the new state before starting the thread. The thread is created but not started.
2. Runnable: The thread is in the runnable state after calling the start() method.
3. Running: The thread is in the running state when the thread scheduler selects the thread to run.
   If thread scheduler allocates the processor to the thread, the thread is in the running state.
4. Blocked: The thread is in the blocked state when the thread is waiting for the resource.
5. Dead: The thread is in the dead state when the run() method completes.
