// prevent thread execution

We can prevent thread execution by using following methods:
1. yield() method
2. join() method
3. sleep() method

1. yield() method: public static native void yield()

-- We can prevent thread execution by using the yield() method. The yield() method is a static method of the Thread class.
It is used to pause the currently executing thread temporarily and give a chance to the remaining waiting threads of the same priority to execute.
If there is no waiting thread or all the waiting threads have a lower priority then the same thread will continue its execution.


-- what if there is higher priority thread is waiting rather than same priority while using yield method?
In this case, the same thread will continue its execution. The waiting thread will not get the chance to execute.
The waiting thread will get the chance only if all the waiting threads have the same priority or lower priority.

-- If multiple threads are waiting with the same priority then the thread which thread will get the chance?
The thread which will get the chance is decided by the thread scheduler.
The thread scheduler is part of the JVM, and it is responsible to decide which thread will get the chance to execute.

-- The thread which is yielded, when it will get the chance to execute again?
The thread which is yielded will get the chance to execute again when the thread scheduler will give the chance to it.

Native method:
The yield() method is a native method. It is implemented in the native language like C or C++.
The yield() method is implemented in the native language because it is related to the thread scheduler which is part of the JVM.


2. join() method:
-- We can prevent thread execution by using the join() method. The join() method is a non-static method of the Thread class.
It is used to pause the currently executing thread until the thread on which it is called is dead.
If the thread on which join() method is called is dead then the currently executing thread will continue its execution.

-- If the thread on which join() method is called is not dead then the currently executing thread will wait until the thread is dead.
The currently executing thread will not continue its execution until the thread is dead.

-- If the thread on which join() method is called is dead then the currently executing thread will continue its execution.
The currently executing thread will not wait.
