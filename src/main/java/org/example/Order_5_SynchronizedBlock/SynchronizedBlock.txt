If very few lines of code then it is not recommended to declare entire method as synchronized. We have to enclose those few lines of the code by using synchronized block.

The main advantages of synchronized block over synchronized method is:
It reduces waiting time of threads and improves performance of the application.

Declare of synchronized block:
1. To get lock of current object.

synchronized(this){
------
------
}
If a thread got lock of current object then only it is allowed to execute this area.

2. To get lock of particular object 'x'.

synchronized(x){
-------
-------
}

If a thread got the lock of particular object 'x'.
Then only it is allowed to execute the area.

2. To get lock of the class level.

synchronized(Display.class){
-------
-------
}
If a thread got class level lock of Display class.
Then only it is allowed to execute this area.
