Case-1:
Lock concept is applicable for object type and class type but not for primitive type.
Hence, we can't pass primitive type as argument to synchronized block.
Otherwise we will get compile time error.

Case-2:
A thread can acquire multiple locks. how? By using synchronized block.
class x{
    public synchronized void m1(){
                        // Here thread acquires lock of object x
        Y y = new Y();
        synchronized(y){
                        // Here thread acquires lock of object y
            Z z = new Z();
            synchronized(z){
                        // Here thread acquires lock of object z
                // some code
                        // So here thread acquires lock of object x, y and z
            }
        }
    }
}




FAQs:
1. What is synchronized keyword and where we can use it?
2. What is the difference between synchronized method and synchronized block?
3. Explain advantages and disadvantages of synchronized keyword.
4. What is Race Condition and how to resolve it?
- if multiple threads are operating on same object and trying to update the same object then there is a chance of data inconsistency problem.
  This problem is called race condition. We can resolve this problem by using synchronized keyword.
5. What is Object lock and when it is required?
6. What is Class lock and when it is required?
7. What is the difference between Object lock and Class lock?
8. What is the advantage of synchronized block over synchronized method?
- In synchronized block, we can lock only required part of the method. Hence, remaining part of the method can be
  accessed by multiple threads simultaneously. Performance will be improved.
9. What is the disadvantage of synchronized block over synchronized method?
- In synchronized block, we have to write more code compared to synchronized method.
10. Is a thread can acquire multiple locks?
- Yes, a thread can acquire multiple locks. how? By using synchronized block. From different objects, a thread acquire multiple locks.
11. What is synchronized statement?
- The statement present inside the synchronized method or synchronized block is called synchronized statement.
